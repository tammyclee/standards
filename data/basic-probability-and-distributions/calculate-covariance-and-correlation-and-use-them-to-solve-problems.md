# Calculate covariance and correlation and use them to solve problems

slug: data.covariance-correlation

## Description
This standard covers the calculation of covariance and correlation and use them to solve problems.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Develop a probability distribution for two random variables defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the covariance
- Describe correlation and its perils with respect to Anscombeâ€™s quartet
- Distinguish correlation and causation
