# Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events

slug: data.probability-compound-uniform

## Description
This standard covers the use of the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Find the conditional probability of A given B as the fraction of B’s outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
- Apply the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
- Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability model, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
- Apply the general Multiplication Rule, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model. 
- Apply the Law of Total Probability, P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and B’), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.  
- Apply the conditional probability of A given B as P(A and B)/P(B), and determine independence of A and B as situations in which the conditional probability of A given B is the same as the probability of A, and the conditional probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.
